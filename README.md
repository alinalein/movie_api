## Test your API ⚙️
Postman was used for testing. To test your API, please open the postman-tests folder in the project and import the file into your Postman client. 

## Deploy your application to Google Cloud
1. Make sure the Google Cloud SDK is installed
Download & install: [Google SKD](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
Then log in
```bash
gcloud auth login
```

2. Set your Google Cloud project
 <br/>
Replace <PROJECT_ID> with your own project ID:

```bash
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```

3. Build your Docker image
 <br/>

**REGION** → e.g. europe-north1<br/>
**PROJECT_ID** → your GCP project<br/>
**REPO_NAME** → your Artifact Registry repo<br/>
**IMAGE_NAME** → name for your container image<br/>

From the root of your project:
```bash
docker build -t <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

4. Push the image to Artifact Registry
```bash
docker push <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:latest
```
5. Deploy to Cloud Run
<br/>

**SERVICE_NAME** → the name of your Cloud Run service<br/>

```bash
gcloud run deploy <SERVICE_NAME> \
  --image <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPO_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:latest \
  --region <REGION> \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```
6. After deployment, Google Cloud will give you a public URL for your API.
